      Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in the Croatia. He immigrated to the United States in 1884 with hopes of meeting Thomas Edison. In the 1880's Tesla was involved in the "War of the Currents," believing alternating current was superior to direct current. This was directly against Edison, who was pushing for direct current. He is responsible for many breakthroughs and inventions that are still relevant today, including wireless communication.
